# Retail-Billing-System
# Problem Statement

A retail billing system is a computer program or software that is used to calculate the total amount to be paid by a customer for the goods or services they have purchased. It is commonly used in retail stores, restaurants, and other businesses that sell products or services to customers. The problem statement is to write a python program to create a retail billing system that can provide an invoice for the customer based on current product stock and discounts.


# Methodology / Procedure

1.	First, you will need to create a list of items that are available for purchase. Each item should have a name, price, and quantity. You could create this list as a list of lists, where each list represents an individual item.
2.	Next, you will need to create a loop to allow the customer to select items and add them to their shopping cart. You could use a while loop that continues until the customer indicates they are finished shopping.
a.	Within the loop, you will need to prompt the user to enter the name of the item they want to add to their cart, and then check if the item is in the list of available items.
b.	If the item is available, you can add it to the shopping cart (which could be represented as a separate list) and update the quantity of the item in the available items list.
3.	After the customer has finished shopping, you can calculate the total cost of the items in the shopping cart by iterating through the list of items and adding up the cost of each item. You can also apply any applicable discounts or taxes at this point.
4.	Finally, you can generate an invoice for the customer by printing out the list of items purchased, the total cost, and any applicable discounts or taxes.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, a simple retail billing system was built. It is a useful tool for calculating the total cost of goods or services purchased by a customer. It can be implemented using a variety of programming languages, such as Python, and can have additional features to track customer purchases, handle returns and exchanges, and manage loyalty programs. Overall, a simple retail billing system can greatly benefit both the business and its customers by providing a convenient and accurate way to purchase and pay for goods and services.
